Game rules:
The goal of the game is to be the first player to get 100 points or more.
The game has 2 players; players take turns rolling a six-sided die.
If a 1 is rolled, then the player gets no points and it becomes the other player's turn.
If the player rolls any other number, i.e. 2 through 6, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues
If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn
The first player to score 100 or more points wins
The purpose of this code is to make a program that gives the players options to roll again or hold, generate random numbers, and also be able to add and display each player's scores
